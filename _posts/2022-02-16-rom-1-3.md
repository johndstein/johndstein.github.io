# Romans 1-3 Summary

God's wrath is against all mankind through all the 
ages because we 
know God exists, and we know we should honor and praise him.
But we deliberately choose to deny this fact. And 
we worship God's creation rather than God himself.

The evil and insanity we see in the world today is God's
judgment against us because we refused to accept the truth of God and
chose to believe a lie.

Being religious, knowing God's laws, or going to church doesn't 
exempt you from this indictment. Everyone is guilty unless they
obey the entire law.

When you judge another person you condemn yourself because you do
the same things. Everyone has broken all of God's law.

There is no one righteous, not even one;
there is no one who understands;
there is no one who seeks God.
All have turned away,
they have together become worthless;
there is no one who does good,
not even one.
Their throats are open graves;
their tongues practice deceit.
The poison of vipers is on their lips.
Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.
Their feet are swift to shed blood;
ruin and misery mark their ways,
and the way of peace they do not know.
There is no fear of God before their eyes.

We can't become good by obeying the law. The law has no power 
to make us good. It was given to show us how bad
we really are.
