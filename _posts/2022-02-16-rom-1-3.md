# Romans 1-3 Summary

This is God's indictment against mankind both now and
down through all the ages.

God's wrath is against us because we 
know God exists, and we know we should honor and praise him.
But we choose to deny this, and 
we worship God's creation instead of worshipping God.

The evil and insanity we see in the world shows God's
judgment against us because we refuse to accept the truth and
chose to believe a lie.

Being religious, knowing God's laws, or going to church doesn't 
exempt us from this indictment. We are all guilty unless we
obey the entire law.

When we judge others we condemn ourselves because we do
the same things. We have all broken all of God's law.

    There is no one righteous, not even one;
    there is no one who understands;
    there is no one who seeks God.
    All have turned away,
    they have together become worthless;
    there is no one who does good,
    not even one.
    Their throats are open graves;
    their tongues practice deceit.
    The poison of vipers is on their lips.
    Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.
    Their feet are swift to shed blood;
    ruin and misery mark their ways,
    and the way of peace they do not know.
    There is no fear of God before their eyes.

We can't become good by obeying the law. The law has no power 
to make us good. It can only show us what is good and
that we don't measure up.
